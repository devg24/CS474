The code outputs sat and gives the equilibrium as r = 0.3 and s = 0.5.

\noindent \textbf{Task 3}: \newline

Let r,s be mixed strategies for each player and let F,B denote two outcomes. This is to say that player 1 chooses f with probability r and b with probability 1-r and player 2 chooses f with probability s and b with probability 1-s. let $p_{ff}$ denote the payoff for player 1 when both players choose f and $p_{fb}$ denote the payoff for player 1 when player 1 chooses f and player 2 chooses b. Let $p_{bf}$ denote the payoff for player 1 when player 1 chooses b and player 2 chooses f and $p_{bb}$ denote the payoff for player 1 when both players choose b. Let $q_{ff}$ denote the payoff for player 2 when both players choose f and $q_{fb}$ denote the payoff for player 2 when player 1 chooses f and player 2 chooses b. Let $q_{bf}$ denote the payoff for player 2 when player 1 chooses b and player 2 chooses f and $q_{bb}$ denote the payoff for player 2 when both players choose b.:

\begin {equation}
\begin{split}
    \psi \equiv \exists r,s . \forall p_{ff}, p_{fb}, p_{bf}, p_{bb}, q_{ff}, q_{fb}, q_{bf}, q_{bb}, r', s' \\ 
    (r*(p_{ff}*s + p_{fb}*(1-s)) + (1-r)*(p_{bf}*s + p_{bb}*(1-s)) \\ \geq r'*(p_{ff}*s + p_{fb}*(1-s)) + (1-r')*(p_{bf}*s + p_{bb}*(1-s))) \\ 
    \land (s*(r*q_{ff} + q_{fb} * (1-r)) + (1-s)*(r*q_{bf} + (1-r)*q_{bb} \\ \geq s'*(r*q_{ff} + q_{fb} * (1-r)) + (1-s')*(r*q_{bf} + (1-r)*q_{bb})))\\ \land (r \geq 0) \land (s \geq 0) \land (r \leq 1) \land (s \leq 1) \land (r' \geq 0) \land (s' \geq 0) \land (r' \leq 1) \land (s' \leq 1)

\section*{Problem 2}

The set of terms T is:

\{a, f(a), g(a), f(g(a)), f(f(a)), f(f(f(a)))\}

the set of equalities E is:

\{ (f(f(f(a))), f(a)), (f(a),g(a)), (f(g(a)), a)\}

the set of inequalities I is:

\{(a,f(a))\}

We start with the equivalence relation:

\{ \{a\}, \{f(a)\}, \{g(a)\}, \{f(g(a))\}, \{f(f(a))\}, \{f(f(f(a)))\} \}

since f(a) and g(a) are equal, we can merge the sets:

\{ \{a\}, \{f(a), g(a)\}, \{f(g(a))\}, \{f(f(a))\}, \{f(f(f(a)))\} \}

since f(g(a)) and a are equal, we can merge the sets:

\{ \{a, f(g(a))\}, \{f(a), g(a)\}, \{f(f(a))\}, \{f(f(f(a)))\} \}

since f(f(f(a))) and f(a) are equal, we can merge the sets:

\{ \{a, f(g(a))\}, \{f(a), g(a), f(f(f(a)))\}, \{f(f(a))\} \}

since f(a) and g(a) are in the same equivalence class, we have to merge the equivalence class of f(f(a)) and f(g(a)):

\{ \{a, f(g(a)), f(f(a))\}, \{f(a), g(a), f(f(f(a)))\} \}

since f(f(a)) and g(a) are in T so we have to merge f(f(f(a))) and f(g(a)) which yields the following equivalence relation:

\{ \{a, f(g(a)), f(f(a)), f(f(f(a))), f(a), g(a)\} \}

since a and f(a)  are in I so this means that the model is unsatisfiable.
